f"""Rank these movies by relevance to the search query.

Query: "{query}"

Movies:
{doc_list_str}

Return ONLY the IDs in order of relevance (best match first). Return a valid JSON list, nothing else. For example:

[75, 12, 34, 2, 1]
This means the movie with idx of 75 is most relevant
i will be parsing with json.loads, so nothing but the list.
